TODOs: 
- architect skills section 
- create component page to hold all other activities 
- create component page for education 
- create contact page 
    - possible to be done with pop up instead 
- considering having the additional roles and skills and education section added as a route switch with a component that will render at the bottom of the page if the user would just like to switch between them at the end of each page 
    - will it still have the "take me back?" 

ENHANCEMENTS: 
- add make viewmore pages just pop ups instead, unless on oa mobile device then they will be shown as other pages. 

- figure out the issue with the user not being returned to the top of the page / find a way to force teh user back to the top of the page without forcing a reload of the page. 


https://codedaily.io/tutorials/Create-a-Modal-Route-with-React-Router

use these code exmaples to build out pop up displays for things 
- using the history object to push to the end of the URL to display a component called a modal?? 



- add a counter to the deployment that just counts how many people have been there. this might be a good thing to do with a data base? setting up a super simple one that acts whenever someoene is going to the homepage.
